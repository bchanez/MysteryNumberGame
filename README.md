## Prerequisites

Before you begin, make sure you have the following tools installed on your machine:

- [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install): To run the application in containers.
- [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/): Your code editor.
- [Dev Containers Extension for VSCode](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-vscode-remote.remote-containers): Open any folder or repository inside a Docker container.

## Environment Setup

1. **Clone the Project Repository**

    Clone the project repository from Git:

    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/bchanez/mystery-number-game.git
    cd mystery-number-game
    ```

2. **Open the Project in VSCode**

    Open VSCode in the project directory:

    ```bash
    code .
    ```

3. **Container Mode**

    Activate Container Mode: When you open the project in VSCode, it should automatically detect the .devcontainer file and prompt you to open the project in a Docker container. Accept this option to configure your development environment within a container.
    Automatic Extensions: The Docker container will automatically install the necessary extensions for Java and Docker development.

## VSCode Extension Troubleshooting

If you encounter issues with VSCode extensions in container mode, follow these steps:

1. **Reload the Window**

    If an extension is not loading properly, try reloading the VSCode window:
    * Press Ctrl+P (or Cmd+P on macOS) to open the Command Palette.
    * Type >Reload Window and press Enter.
